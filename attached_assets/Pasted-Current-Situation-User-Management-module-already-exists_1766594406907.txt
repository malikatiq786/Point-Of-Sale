Current Situation:
- User Management module already exists
- Roles and permissions structure also exists
- BUT the system is NOT working properly
- Users are not fully dynamic
- Roles and permissions are not properly connected to system modules
- Some users can access things they should not
- Some restrictions are not enforced

Core Requirement:
I want the ENTIRE POS system to work strictly based on
ROLE-BASED ACCESS CONTROL (RBAC).

Expected Correct Behavior:

1. User Management:
- Users must be fully dynamic and stored in the database
- Each user must have:
   - role_id (or multiple roles if supported)
   - assigned permissions
- Login user context must be used everywhere in the app

2. Roles:
- Roles like:
   - Super Admin
   - Admin
   - Manager
   - Cashier
   - Staff
- Roles must define what a user CAN or CANNOT access

3. Permissions:
- Permissions must control:
   - View
   - Create
   - Edit
   - Delete
   - Approve
- Example:
   - products.view
   - products.create
   - purchases.approve
   - sales.refund
   - users.manage

4. System-wide Enforcement (VERY IMPORTANT):
- EVERY module must respect role & permission checks:
   - Dashboard
   - Products
   - Purchases
   - Sales POS
   - Returns
   - Inventory
   - Stock Management
   - Reports
   - User Management
- No screen, button, or API should be accessible without permission

5. UI-Level Control:
- Hide buttons if user lacks permission:
   - Add Product
   - Edit
   - Delete
   - Approve Purchase
   - Stock Adjust
- Sidebar menu must show ONLY allowed modules

6. Backend-Level Security:
- Permissions must be checked on:
   - APIs
   - Controllers
   - Actions
- UI hiding alone is NOT enough

7. Data Integrity & Safety:
- Existing POS functionality MUST NOT break
- Existing flows (sales, purchases, stock, reports) must continue working
- Only ADD permission checks, do NOT remove existing logic
- No dummy data
- No hardcoded user IDs

8. Maintainability:
- Central permission checking logic
- Easy to add new roles or permissions later
- Clean, scalable enterprise architecture

Action Required:
- Analyze current user, role, and permission system
- Fix missing connections between users, roles, and permissions
- Enforce role-permission logic across the entire POS system
- Ensure the system behaves like a real-world enterprise POS

IMPORTANT:
Do NOT change UI design.
Do NOT remove existing features.
Only improve and FIX access control and user management logic.
