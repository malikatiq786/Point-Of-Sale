4. Frontend receives authentication status and user data
5. Protected routes check authentication status via session

### Sales Transaction Flow
1. Cashier searches and selects products in POS terminal
2. Items added to shopping cart with quantities
3. Customer information optionally collected
4. Payment method selected and transaction initiated
5. Sale recorded in database with all item details
6. Inventory levels automatically updated
7. Activity logged for audit trail

### Data Synchronization
- Real-time updates using React Query's automatic refetching
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Error handling with automatic retry mechanisms
- Cache invalidation on mutations

- **Environment Variables**: Local .env file configuration

### Production Build
- **Frontend**: Vite production build with code splitting and optimization
- **Backend**: esbuild compilation to ES modules
- **Static Assets**: Served through Express with fallback to SPA routing
- **Database**: Production PostgreSQL with proper connection pooling

### Deployment Architecture
- **Single Server**: Express serves both API and static frontend files
- **Database**: External PostgreSQL instance (Neon)
- **Session Storage**: PostgreSQL-backed sessions for scalability
- **Environment**: Production environment variables for security

The system is designed to be easily deployable on Replit with automatic provisioning of the PostgreSQL database and environment configuration. The monorepo structure keeps all components together while maintaining clear separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and shared code.
